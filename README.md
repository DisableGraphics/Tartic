# Tartic
A graphical text editor that follows suckless's philosophy. 

# Compiling

```cd Tartic && make && sudo make install```

# Dependencies
GtkMM-3 (And, of course, Gtk) and GCC.

# Some things that must be clarified
Suckless people: I'm sorry. This text editor has been made more as a joke than anything. I don't really believe in the 'If I don't use some widget the 100% of the time I'm using the app, it's useless and should be deleted' vibes I get from suckless projects. While I know bloat is bad (My computer kinda sucks), this vision is, in my opinion, and feel free to correct me, too extremist.
